# ghost-theme-adambalm

This is a lightly customized fork of the official Ghost `Dawn` theme, created as part of a job application project.

The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate:

- Hands-on familiarity with Ghost CMS theming and structure
- Git-based theme management and deployment
- Ability to modify templates (`.hbs` files), use partials, and work with helpers
- Basic navigation edits, conditional rendering, and customization of theme behavior
- Understanding of workflow constraints (local development, manual `.zip` deployment, GitHub repo versioning)

The live site is deployed at:  
?? **[adambalm.ghost.io](https://adambalm.ghost.io)**

You can preview the theme source code from the site's navigation under **“View Theme Code.”**

More updates coming soon.
