# Ghost Theme: Adambalm (Dawn Fork)

This is a lightly customized fork of the official Ghost Dawn theme.

It currently demonstrates:

- Familiarity with Ghost CMS theming and structure  
- Git-based theme management and deployment  
- Template editing using `.hbs` files, partials, and helpers  
- Navigation updates and conditional rendering  
- Local development with `.zip` deployment and GitHub versioning  

**Live site:** [adambalm.ghost.io](https://adambalm.ghost.io)  
**Theme source:** Linked from the site’s navigation under “View Theme Code”

## To-Do

- Add `routes.yaml` to support custom routing  
- Improve mobile header spacing and logo sizing  
- Replace placeholder images and polish visuals  
- Set up GitHub Actions + Admin API for CI-based deploys  
- Document key theme helpers and partials used  

This is a work in progress and will continue to evolve.
