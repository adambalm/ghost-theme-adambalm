# Ghost Theme: Adambalm (Dawn Fork)

This is a lightly customized fork of the official [Ghost Dawn theme](https://github.com/TryGhost/Dawn), created to demonstrate readiness for the Ghost CMS Administrator role at Sticker Mule.

---

##  Purpose

This theme powers both a **Ghost(Pro)** site and a new **containerized, Docker-based deployment**, which is currently under development. The Ghost(Pro) instance was created first to allow early submission of application materials. Development then shifted to the self-hosted instance to reflect a more production-relevant deployment workflow.

---

##  Live Instances

- Ghost(Pro): [adambalm.ghost.io](https://adambalm.ghost.io)
- Self-hosted (Render): [ghost-deploy-adambalm.onrender.com](https://ghost-deploy-adambalm.onrender.com)

The sites are not yet visually identical. Final polish and synchronization is planned before cutting over fully to the Render-hosted instance. A redirect will follow.

---

##  Currently Demonstrates

- Familiarity with Ghost CMS theming and structure
- Git-based theme management and deployment
- Template editing using `.hbs` files, partials, and helpers
- Custom routing via `routes.yaml`
- Navigation updates and conditional rendering
- Local development and theme ZIP deployment via Admin panel

##  To-Do

- [ ] Final visual polish and sync between Pro and Render
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions + Admin API for CI-based theme deployment
- [ ] Implement editorial-friendly features: tag-based filtering, internal tags, members-only content
- [ ] Document theme structure and key helpers for maintainability
- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Change ridiculous author photo

This is an evolving demonstration project with further refinements expected as part of the job application process.
