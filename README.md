# ghost-theme-adambalm

This is a lightly customized fork of the official Ghost `Dawn` theme, created as part of a job application.

So far we have documented:

- Hands-on familiarity with Ghost CMS theming and structure
- Git-based theme management and deployment
- Ability to modify templates (`.hbs` files), use partials, and work with helpers
- Basic navigation edits, conditional rendering, and customization of theme behavior
- Understanding of workflow constraints (local development, manual `.zip` deployment, GitHub repo versioning)

The live site is deployed at:  
?? **[adambalm.ghost.io](https://adambalm.ghost.io)**

You can preview the theme source code from the site's navigation under **“View Theme Code.”**

## To-Do

- [ ] Add `routes.yaml` to support future custom routing
- [ ] Improve mobile header spacing and logo sizing
- [ ] Replace placeholder images and polish visuals
- [ ] Implement GitHub Actions + Admin API for CI-based deploys
- [ ] Document key theme helpers and partials used


More updates coming soon.
